The Tim Berners-Lee project with BeCode is an exercise in using what we have already learned in html and css to create an exact replica of predefined mockup page dedicated to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of HTML. 
To do this, we were given images of how the content should look first in HTML and then with CSS styling.
